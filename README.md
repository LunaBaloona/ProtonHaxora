# Protonhax GUI for Cheathappens Aurora

## The Problem
Cheathappens Aurora has its own launcher, but it limits what Proton versions can be selected. Some Linux distros have custom Proton varients, which may run your games better, but you'll not be able to select the from Aurora.  There are work arounds but they are very terminal heavy, and we want to make things easy for Linux newcomers. 

## The solution
ProtonHaxora. It can run your game with ProtonHax which lets you run any app (in this case Aurora.exe) inside your preferred Proton. This runs in terminal, but ProtonHaxora combines the powers of ProtonHax, and Aurora in one-ish GUI. 

## Features
* **Auto-Discovery:** Finds then lists your installed Steam games. Tell it what game you need to attach Aurora to for your session. 
* **Easy Launching:** If you installed Aurora in the default directory, it will launch as long as the game is running.
